              ProcrastriTracker is an open source <em>time tracking tool</em> that automatically
              tracks what applications and documents you use, and allows you to view statistics on
              your usage in great detail.
              It is written to be small and non-intrusive. It is
              useful for: </span>
            <ul>
              <li class="style13"><em><strong>Increasing your productivity</strong></em>: seeing
                long term stats on
                what really is costing you the most time can help shift priorities to work more
                optimally. </li>
              <li class="style13"><em><strong>Tracking and billing time</strong></em>: when working
                on multiple projects
                / for multiple clients, nearly automatically! </li>
              <li class="style13"><em><strong>Fun!</strong></em> Seeing such detailed statistics is
                plain interesting,
                especially over longer time, even if you don't intend to do anything with it. </li>

              <li class="style9"><span class="style14"><strong><em>Most detailed statistics of any
                      timetracking app</em></strong>: ProcrastriTracker doesn't just track documents
                  and web sites for every application, it gathers information fully hierarchically,
                  meaning
                  that you can see documents on a per project basis (such as in visual studio). This
                  happens fully automatically, any application or web site that deals with data in
                  an hierarchical fashion, and shows items in its title bar seperated by " - ", " |
                  ", " : ", &quot; &gt; &quot; or &quot;\&quot; will be represented hierarchically.
                </span></li>
              <li class="style13"><strong><em>Filtering</em></strong>: the statistics view allows
                you to quickly drill down to subsets of the data, fold/unfold trees, limit displayed
                entries to a particular date range, tag, or minimum number of seconds used (to
                reduce clutter) </li>
              <li class="style13"><strong><em>Tagging</em></strong>: allows you to group items to
                better track different uses and different projects. Tags color the bargraphs for an
                instant view. Tags work hierarchically, so items are counted as tagged like their
                parent unless you tag them explicitly. </li>
              <li class="style13"><strong><em>Precise Idle time</em></strong>: takes into account
                the time when you are semi idle (default 10 seconds of inactivity) and fully idle
                (default 3 minutes of inactivity) for a more accurate picture of how much time was
                truely spent on an item. </li>
              <li class="style13"><strong><em>Written for efficiency</em></strong>: Procrastitracker
                uses a custom database that uses very little memory, can be updated quickly, and has
                a highly compressed on-disk representation. It is also using straight win32 for
                reduced DLL footprint. It is so tiny, you won't know its there :) </li>
              <li class="style13"><strong><em>HTML Export</em></strong>: export the data using the
                current filters to a very readable HTML layout for easy sharing with other people.
              </li>
              <li class="style13"><strong><em>Backups</em></strong>: automated saving (default every
                10 minutes) and backups both per save and per run make sure you never lose data on
                system crashes, and allow you to easily go back to a previous database in the
                unlikely event of database corruption. </li>
              <li class="style13"><strong><em>Automated culling</em></strong>: Older items in the
                database that were used for very few seconds are culled, and their stats added to
                the parent item. This keeps timing accurate but reduces on clutter and database
                size. </li>
              <li class="style13"><strong><em>Input activity statistics</em></strong>: for every
                item, the amount of keyboard and mouseclicks are counted. </li>
              <li class="style14"><span class="style9"><strong><em>Compatability</em></strong>:
                  Every version of ProcrastiTracker still loads databases from the earliest versions
                  (back to 2007), and will continue to do so. This guarantees that you can run it
                  for years, and gather some impressive statistics, meanwhile being able to get new
                  features. Data is stored in a relatively generic way so that the representation
                  can evolve even if the data doesn't.
                </span>
              <li class="style13"><strong><em>Configurable</em></strong>: Every timing setting can
                be tweaked to suit the way you work. </li>

              <span class="style9"> ProcrastiTracker runs in your system tray, and by defaults
                checks every 5 seconds what application (and document/site/title) you are using, and
                enters this into its database. If you haven't used the mouse/keyboard for more than
                3 minutes, it stops checking (to make sure statistics are acurate when you walk away
                from your computer). It saves its internal database every 10 minutes, so data
                collection is fully automatic. </span>

                  The main tree view shows ranked in order of most use all items with total time,

                  below that a hierarchical tree based on the window title that was active at the
                  time (how effective this is depends on the application).
                  Web browsers (supported: Chrome, firefox, IE and Opera) additionally have as their
                  second level in the hierarchy the domain name of the active page, so you get your
                  statistics grouped by site. </span>

                  items, the bar will be subdivided accordingly). </span>

                    To the left are filtering options, you can use the slider to quickly set how far
                    the tree is expanded for all nodes (you can of course also do this manually per
                    node). Use the seconds filter to not show (but still count) any items below the
                    given seconds, this allows you to get a better overview without clutter in
                    larger databases.
                    Use the date range popups to see data only for a specified period (defaults to
                    viewing the entire database). </span>

                <p class="style14">
                  <span class="style9">Below this is a list of "tags" you can apply to tree nodes,
                    which allows you to group activities and get a better overview. You can apply
                    the
                    currently selected tag to the currently selected tree node using the button.
                    Note
                    how this makes the tag the default for all nodes below it too, but you can still
                    categorize sub tree items differently (you can for example mark "firefox" as
                    "surfing"
                    by default, but certain sites below it you can mark as "work"). The UNTAGGED tag
                    is special in that setting it makes the node assume whatever tag its parents
                    uses.
                    You can rename tags similarly to files in windows explorer: by double clicking
                    on an already
                    selected tag (or click the &quot;Rename Tag&quot; button). Check the "filter on
                    tag" box to see stats only for the current tag (as opposed to all tags). This is
                    useful for seeing the time spent in a particular
                    category.&nbsp;</span>

                    export allows you to export part or all of the database (based on the same
                    filtering settings), that can then later be merged elsewhere.

                          that have only accumulated very few seconds, by merging them into their
                          parent. This has the beneficial effect of reducing clutter (especially for
                          those apps that use their title bar for progress updates), reducing memory
                          and disk usage (smaller database). It is probably a good idea to slowly
                          increase this number as your database grows, i.e. using it for many
                          months. Since culling happens on load, you have to re-start
                          ProcrastiTracker for this to take effect. One of the advantages of it
                          happening on Load is that it gives items the opportunity to accumulate
                          more seconds on independent occurrances, and thus not be culled

                          breaks longer than that are not considered part of your work day anymore).
                          When you are away for longer than the time in your idle setting (and less
                          than your maximum break setting), upon return a window will pop up asking
                          you what you spent the time on. Right now these are not configurable,
                          sorry, though there is a variety of them and 2 custom ones.
                          You can also choose to not track this time with the bottom button.
                          Time tracked this way will appear under the "Away" heading in the main
                          view.

          you want to merge, followed by selecting the node you want to merge into, and then
          pressing CTRL+M.
